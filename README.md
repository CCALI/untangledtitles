# untangledtitles
PHilly hackathon project


Create a guided interview that helps legal services advocates complete complicated paperwork in the course of resolving a tangled title dispute

The Center for Legal Servicesâ€™ homeownership unit helps its clients resolve tangled title disputes. A tangled title dispute occurs when the ownership of a house is disputed. Filling out the tangled title forms manually is tedious, repetitive, and time-consuming work. Automating part of this process with a guided interview that generates the final documents will save hundreds of hours a year for advocates. Advocates will be able to spend that saved time on serving more low-income Philadelphians.
